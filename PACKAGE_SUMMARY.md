### Test Performance
```
✅ RAM-first storage: Working (microsecond access)
✅ 9D spatial search: Working (semantic relevancy detection)  
✅ Rolling pair saves: Working (A/B alternation, corruption protection)
✅ Context building: Working (recent + relevant combination)
✅ Capacity management: Working (automatic promotion to long-term)
✅ Recovery system: Working (loaded 5 entries from disk)

Performance: 9.61 seconds total, 16 exchanges processed, 2 promoted to long-term
```

### Advanced Contextual Test
- **30-step creative conversation**: Magical world-building scenario
- **12 semantic searches**: 99%+ relevance scores achieved
- **44 exchanges processed**: 22 searches, 560 cache hits
- **0.068 MB memory usage**: Efficient resource utilization

### Breakthrough Demonstration
```python
# Search for "coordinated spellcasting" 
# Finds: "battle harmony magic" with 99.6% relevance
# WITHOUT any training or manual categorization!

search_result = stm_api.search_relevant("coordinated spellcasting")
# Returns conversations about magical teamwork, battle coordination, etc.
```

## 🎯 API Highlights

### Simple Integration
```python
from STM_API import create_stm_api

# Create STM instance
stm_api = create_stm_api(max_entries=100, verbose=True)

# Add conversations
result = stm_api.add_conversation(
    user_message="Tell me about machine learning",
    ai_response="Machine learning enables computers to learn from data..."
)

# Search semantically
search_results = stm_api.search_relevant("artificial intelligence")

# Build enhanced context
context = stm_api.get_context("I want to learn about AI")
```
